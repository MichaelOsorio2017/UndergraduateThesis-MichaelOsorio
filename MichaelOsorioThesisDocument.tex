The number of different tools to explore Android applications has been increasing. Every tool has a different exploration strategy and clam to offer different benefits than others. The huge amount of tools and the lack of impartial information about them makes that developers and researchers have no basis and data to face a decision-making situation or data to compare their own new tools. 
Others studies have made different comparisons between exploration tools in the past, but most of those tools are no longer being used in the industry or in the academy, that is why there is a need of studies providing clear and unbiased information about the newest tools that allows the developers and researchers to acquire a better perspective of the modern exploration tools. 
That is the reason why in this study, four of the most used tools for automatic exploration of Android applications are analysed and compared according their progressive and achieved method coverage, and the max number of errors found in one exploration. Besides, a reproducible workflow is proposed for future studies of the same type as well as two tools for allowing faster and easier comparison are described.

First, I want to express my deepest thanks to Professor Mario Linares-Vásquez for helping me with the development of this final work, giving me the necessary feedback for getting this project to this final version, and new ideas and ways to solve the presented problems while executing this research.

Second, I would like to give my thanks to all the members of The Software Design Lab, for sharing with me their experiences and knowledge that were very important for developing this thesis. Especially to Camilo Escobar for his great help giving the main concept of InstruAPK, for helping with its implementation, besides giving me feedback about the figures in this text as well as solving some extra questions and doubts that I had during the process of developing this thesis.

Third, I want to say thanks to my mother and sister for keeping me motivated within all my major, till the last moment of it. For their unconditional support and for being there in the moments I needed them the most. 

At last, but not least important, I want to say thanks to all my friends for sharing their knowledge with me, and contributing with that to this thesis. 

Without the help of the mentioned people, this work would not be possible.

I wish to clarify that the order in the mention does not reflect the level of thankfully I feel for the people mentioned in this statement. All of them supported this work in different ways, and under their capabilities,. Helping me in one way or another to reach this results. For that reason, all of them deserve the same feelings from my. One more time, thanks to all of them.
